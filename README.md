The Dai Credit System relies on auctions for collateral liquidation and
incentivisation of MKR holders. However, despite occasional interest,
there has been little public development of off chain auction agents.

The aim of this project is to develop a framework for bidding on the
auctions and market and allow new trading strategies to be easily implemented.
It will also be easy to simulate this aspect of the system and
potentially search for dynamical instabilities in usage.
