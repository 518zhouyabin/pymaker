Maker Keeper Framework
======================

This projects consists of three parts:

* a set of APIs around smart contacts of the `SAI Stablecoin System` and some other related smart contracts,
* a few examples showing how to use these APIs,
* a few sample keepers i.e. profit-seeking bots, executing certain operations automatically.

**Beware!** These APIs are still in a very early stage of development and they will very likely change
and/or evolve together with the `SAI Stablecoin System`.
