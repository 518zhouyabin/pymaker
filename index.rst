maker.py
========

`maker.py` provides a simple way of interacting with a set of smart contracts that create the `SAI Stablecoin System`.

This projects consists of three parts:

* a set of APIs around smart contacts of the `SAI Stablecoin System` and some other related smart contracts,
* a few examples showing how to use these APIs,
* a few sample keepers i.e. profit-seeking bots, executing certain operations automatically.
