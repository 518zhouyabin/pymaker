Maker Keeper Framework
======================

This projects consists of two parts:

* a set of APIs around smart contacts of the `SAI Stablecoin System` and some other related smart contracts,
* a set of reference keepers i.e. profit-seeking bots, executing certain operations automatically.

**Beware!** These APIs are still in a very early stage of development and they will very likely change
and/or evolve together with the `SAI Stablecoin System`.
